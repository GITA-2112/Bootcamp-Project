# Bootcamp-Project
Title : Restaurant Sentiment Analysis  - in Depth of Classification Algorithms
## Objective :
"The primary objective of this project is to explore the potential growth that can be achieved by applying sentiment analysis techniques and classification algorithms according to restaurant customer reviews."

### Source : https://github.com/manthanpatel98/Restaurant-Review-Sentiment-Analysis/tree/master

## Highlight Overview :
- Dataset Original 10,000 rows & 8 columns
- Try to perform NLP by using the "Review" and "Rating columns"

## Content : 
Implementing CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining), framework for conducting data mining and machine learning projects. 
1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
5. Modeling : Apply Classification Algorithm for Sentiment Analysis
   - Logistic Regression
   - KNNeighbor Classifier 
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - Random Forest Classifier
6. Metrics Evaluation for Binary Sentiment Classification (Positive / Negative)
   - Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions (correctly predicted positive sentiment) among all positive predictions.
   - Recall (Sensitivity) measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances
   - F1- Score measure the balancing between precision and recall
8. Cross Validation : Consider using k-fold cross-validation for a robust evaluation

10. Imbalance Handling
11. Hyperparameter Tuning
12. Evaluation
13. Model Deployment

## Model Deployment 
API or web service that exposes sentiment analysis model.

## Future Works
1. Review Express is an automation tool that sends review requests via email.
   also add private surveys to the emails and ask for deeper feedback.
2. Review Express - Written reviews directly generate "Rating Automation"
